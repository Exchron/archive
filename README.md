## Exploration Archive

This repository contains data exploration done prior to the main machine learning feature selection & model devlopment.This contains scripts and notebooks used to explore the data, visualize patterns, and identify potential features for the machine learning models.

- Lightcurve data obtained via lightkurve package.
- Scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature extraction.
- Jupyter notebooks documenting the exploration process and findings.
- Visualizations such as plots and charts to illustrate data insights.

This also includes the datasets used to create on-device training pipeline via browser JS using TensorFlow.js under the `classroom` directory.
